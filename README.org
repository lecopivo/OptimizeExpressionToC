* Optimize Expression to C

  This is a [[https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/][Mathematica]] function which takes an expression and spits out an
  optimized C code to evaluate this expression.

* Examples

   You can find an example of implementing stereographic projection and its derivative at =example/example.nb= and =example/example.cpp=.
  
   The notebook =example.nb= generates the mathematical expressions for stereographic projection turns them into a C++ code which is then inserted into =example.cpp= and final =main.cpp= is generated. This can then be compiled with =g++ main.cpp=.
